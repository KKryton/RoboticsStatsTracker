# RoboticsStatsTracker
Thanks for checking out my project! You may be wondering, what does this do?

My name is Damien and I am the secretary of my school's robotics club; we compete in the FIRST Tech Challenge.

The point of this program is to track our game stats; tracking Auto scores, TeleOp scores, and Endgame scores will help us
track our progression throughout the season to see how we have improved and where else we can improve.

AS OF CURRENTLY, this program is really only meant to be for us but after I refine it and make it look pretty we may send it
out to other teams for them to utilize and improve. Not only do we want to improve ourselves, we want to empower
other teams to reach their potential and make FIRST a better place. With that said, if this program isn't that great, or doesn't
get finished, I wouldn't want to send out an unfinished project to other teams.

What I envision this program becoming:
- Store data from matches on a per person basis.
- Show said data in a readable format.
- Perform calculations as needed on said data, such as retrieving averages and whatnot.
- Suggest probabilities for what stats can be achieved and how long it might take.
- (It's basically a stats calculator in all honesty, we will see where it goes!)

IMPORTANT: If you don't have python installed it won't work. Go to the Microsoft Store app or whatever the
native store app is for your operating system, then install the latest Python version. I don't know which
verion in specific is the minimum supported but I would suggest getting the latest one anyways. I am on
version 3.12.5 but I am aware of a 3.14 release. No external dependencies or packages are needed, this 
program uses native python libraries to maximize portability.
